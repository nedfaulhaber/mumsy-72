        <p>Colin Stetson approaches the saxophone like no one else, period.  There is simply nobody out there that plays with the type of percussive intensity as he does, slapping his bass sax keys as if they were drums, and using a circular breathing pattern to create loops that hypnotize while simultaneously being an all-out attack of sub-sonic notes.  He growls, he uses altissimo to blow above the instrument's capability, he sings and cries through the horn.  A true virtuoso of his instrument, he also manages to move between genres seamlessly.  While his solo work has always been of the aforementioned ilk, he has also played extensively with indie-rock groups such as Arcade Fire and Animal Collective, singer-songwriters like Tom Waits and Bon Iver, and art-pop masters Laurie Anderson and David Byrne.  This is only a partial list of who he's lent his talents to.</p>
        <p>British Columbia native Sarah Neufeld has played violin with indie-rock band Arcade Fire since 2007, in recent years only lending a hand on tours.  She met Stetson through his collaborations with the band, and the two quickly became a duo fascinated with each other.  Neufeld is also no hack at her instrument, to say the least, and she is also capable of moving from experimental to pop sounds with ease.  In addition to playing with Arcade Fire, she has a couple of solo albums, and plays with the Montreal instrumental group Bell Orchestre.</p>
        <p>The fertile partnership has led to composing with each other multiple times - first for the score of the film <em>Blue Caprice</em>, then, more recently, the 2015 album <em>Never Were the Way She Was</em>, where the two create a wondrous drone of notes that creates a flurry of pitches that weave together to sound more like only a few tones.  The result, despite its ferocity, can wash over you meditatively.  Both musicians are capable of massive sounds, but mostly keep mellow on the record, which works great for a sunny morning meditation or a yoga session, despite being well left of center and far from the "New Age".  Stetson and Neufeld prove that two virtuosos doing what their hearts desire can be approachable and mind-bending at the same time.</p>
