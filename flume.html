        <p>In 2011, when Australian electronic producer and DJ Harley Edward Streten was 21, he submitted 3 songs to a local record label's original music contest, and was selected as the winner, earning him his first release, the EP <em>Sleepless</em>.  With its release, Streten chose a pseudonym, Flume, taken from a Bon Iver song by the same name.  Like <em>Sleepless</em>, his eponymous 2012 album <em>Flume</em> was composed entirely on his laptop.  Streten completed <em>Flume</em> in London and submitted it to the label remotely.  By the time he returned to his native country, the album was topping the Australian charts.  Soon, he was remixing famous artists' songs and touring internationally.</p>

        <p>For all the success of his first album, it was 2016's <em>Skin</em> that made Flume internationally famous.  <em>Skin</em> won the Grammy for Best Dance/Electronic Album at this year's awards ceremony.  The album features an onslaught of big-name guests from a wide range of genres, including rappers Vince Staples, Raekwon, and Vic Mensa, plus singer-songwriter Beck and Swedish superstar pop singer/songwriter Tove Lo.  His breakthrough radio single, though, featured a relatively unknown Canadian singer, Kai.  Entitled "Never Be Like You", it was Flume's first number one single and first massive hit worldwide, gracing American radio stations all summer.</p>
        <p>The second single from the album, "Say It", featuring Tove Lo, was also a hit, and had more of an edge than the first single.  Featuring Flume's wicked electro-percussive noise over a giant synth-wave, it is musically amazing, and then adding Tove Lo's catchy melody, it is a perfect cross between pop and glitchy electronica.  The crashing wave of drums and synth that hits at the beginning of the chorus is an appropriate metaphor for Flume's 2016.  And at only 25 years of age, we can only assume that there will be many more waves to come.</p>
