        <p>What can I possibly say about Lin-Manuel Miranda that you don't know already?  The musical theater genius was already huge in that sphere and now is nearly a household name.  <em>Hamilton</em> turns out to have been the most unlikely of combinations (founding fathers and hip-hop??) to catapult him to a pop culture phenom status far beyond the stage.  With appearances on TV shows both big (<em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em>) and small (<em>My Brother, My Brother, and Me</em>), voice performances for popular animated series such as <em>BoJack Horseman</em> and <em>Duck Tales</em>, scores and songs for huge films like <em>Moana</em> and <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em>, SNL hosting, and more, he is seemingly everywhere these days.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Miranda has been in the news for political reasons, speaking out publicly against President Trump for his idiocy surrounding the Puerto Rican disaster and organizing the creation of a charity song, "Almost Like Praying", which involved Latino artists from a variety of styles and different age groups collaborating to help fund relief efforts.  He most recently paired with fellow theater star Ben Platt for a mash-up of <em>Hamilton's</em> "The Story of Tonight" and <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> "You Will Be Found" that benefitted the March For Our Lives.  The two then performed <a class="info-link" href="https://slate.com/culture/2018/03/lin-manuel-miranda-and-ben-platt-performed-their-hamilton-dear-evan-hansen-mashup-at-the-march-for-our-lives.html">the mash-up</a> together at the March.</p>
        <p>At this point, Miranda has racked up a Pulitzer Prize, three Tony Awards, three Grammys, an Emmy, an Academy Award nomination, and a MacArthur Fellowship.  And has it been mentioned that he writes some of the most memorable music of our time?</p>

        <p>One such piece of music comes from <em>Hamilton</em> and features singer and actor Jonathan Groff as King George III.  "You'll Be Back" is unique in the production because it is completely devoid of hip-hop.  Miranda says that this was on purpose, setting up the king as representing tradition and the Americans as rebels breaking from it.  Groff himself has a massive list of impressive appearances in the entertainment biz.  He did the voice of Kristoff in the massive Disney hit <em>Frozen</em> in 2013, was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for his performance in <em>Spring Awakening</em> in 2006, and again was nominated for his peformance in <em>Hamilton</em> as well</p>.  He has acted on TV in <em>Glee</em>, <em>Mindhunter</em>, and the HBO series <em>Looking</em>.  In <em>Looking</em>,
