        <p>North Long Beach rapper Vince Staples' career follows a classic hip-hop success-against-all-odds story.  A gang-member as a teen, Staples managed to quickly rise to prominence via his deft rapping skills.  His close association with LA-based rap collective Odd Future (Earl Sweatshirt, Frank Ocean, Tyler the Creator, among others) allowed him the exposure to be heard by high-profile rapper/producer Mac Miller, who produced an album featuring Staples as his collaborator in 2014.  Before long, Staples had released his debut, <em>Hell Can Wait</em>, which quickly established him as a no-nonsense, no-frills storyteller of life in the ghetto of North Long Beach.  Like Kendrick Lamar and others, Staples' lyrics were honest - mixing boasts with self-doubt - and like Lamar, he quickly gained a following among listeners and acclaim from critics.  His release <em>Summertime '06</em> in 2015 saw Staples' build upon his intial success and resulted in high-profile collaborations with other rappers as well as pop artists such as <a class=info-link href="http://cms.springboardplatform.com/embed_iframe/159/video/1640079/rab010/rapbasement.com/10">James Blake</a>.</p>
        <p>Staples' rise in prominence doesn't seem to be abating anytime soon. 2017 saw him release his second full-length album, <em>Big Fish Theory</em>, to even more critical acclaim.  Tickets for this supporting tour, featuring massive screens that portrayed a fish tank and an arena-like laser show, consistently sold out.  Meanwhile, it seems like everytime you listen to a new record, Staples pops up as a guest on a track, and he is just finishing up a tour with Tyler the Creator that has lasted for most of 2018.  On top of it all, his song "Bag Bak" recently appeared in the trailer for the mega-hit film <em>Black Panther</em>.  There's no question that Vince Staples, despite his apparent disdain for stardom, is on a collision course with it.</p>
