        <p>Born in Eastern Havana, Cuba, Cuban-American singer Camila Cabello has made a big splash in her short time on earth.  Only 21 now, she found her way into the music industry at age 15 on the reality competition show <em>The X Factor</em>.  Though she didn't win the competition, she was invited back to perform with a group of four other female contestants.  As it turned out, this group, calling themselves Fifth Harmony, became successful on the charts with multiple top ten hits.  As with Justin Timberlake in N-Sync, however, Cabello clearly outshown the other four singers, and it became only a matter of time before she was to move on to greener pastures as a solo artist.</p>
        <p>The official announcement came in late 2016.  After appearing as a featured artist on numerous songs of varying styles (hip-hop, EDM, Latin, etc.), she came out with a single of her own that reached 47 on the Hot 100.  What came next turned out to be the song that launched her to superstardom - "Havana", featuring high-profile Atlanta rapper Young Thug.  The song raced to #1 with its infectious mix of Cuban groove and trumpet and American R&B, and when her solo album, <em>Camila</em> arrived a short while later, it too shot to number one.  Her incredible presence as a live artist (as seen on many performances like <a class="info-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ptAX7nTX6s&list=RD7ptAX7nTX6s&t=13" target="_blank">this one</a> from the Tonight Show) has led to her inclusion as the opener for the Taylor Swift tour in 2018.  With that exposure, her already huge fanbase is only going to increase.</p>

        <p>Though typically a rough and tumble "trap" rapper, Atlanta's Young Thug has been known to mix it up and hasn't shyed away from allowing himself to be goofy in a way that many rappers seem afraid to do.  His quirky performance on "Havana" is a perfect example of Thug getting playful.  As a hugely successful artist, his inclusion on Cabello's song was certainly a factor in gaining it the initial attention that it did.</p>
