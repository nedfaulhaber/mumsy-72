        <p>Yitaku, hailing from Minneapolis, MN, is yet another example of the current importance of SoundCloud to the new music landscape.  A home producer of electronic music, Yitaku has release 3 EP's in addition to joining a group of producers in their teens and early 20's called the Paper Crane Collective.  The collective became a reality when young LA producer Madnap began reaching out to other SoundCloud musicians whom he liked.  Eventually, a network developed and the collective expanded from a few people to a group of about a dozen producers from all over the country, like-minded but representing a diverse spectrum of electronic music.</p>
        <p>After 3 compilations of songs by the varying members (<em>Volumes 1-3</em>), Paper Crane released their 4th feature called <em>Auragami</em> in 2016.  With its large following on SoundCloud, Madnap was able to put together a short tour with stops in LA and New York to present events and debut their new line of clothing and other merchandise that the group collaborated on creating.  Self-described now as a Music / Event Series / Community / Merch collective, Paper Crane continues to exhibit their forward-thinking, entrepeneurial spirit, presenting events around the LA area and beyond.</p>
