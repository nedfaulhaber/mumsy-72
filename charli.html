        <p>British songstress Charli XCX (born Charlotte Aitchison in 1992) has had an interesting and unconventional career path, with guest appearances, singles, albums, mixtapes, and songwriting credits for other artists.  As a mere 14 year old, she began writing songs, and with a loan from her parents, recorded them professionally.  After posting the resulting recordings online, she was discovered in 2008 by a local promoter of illegal warehouse raves in east London, and with the blessing of her parents, began to perform at his parties.  Again, she was noticed, and in 2011, after guesting on one prominent pop recording, she followed it up with two of her own singles that were lauded by critics as some of the best new songs of the year.  She followed the singles up with two mixtapes (self-released albums, not actual tapes, are currently known as "mixtapes") in 2012.</p>
        <p>Her first big break came in 2013, when she lent her vocal talents to "I Love You", a song by Swedish group Icona Pop, which went to #1 on the UK singles chart.  Two more of her own singles were then released to more critical acclaim, as well as her first album, which was met with moderate reviews from critics.  Then, in 2014, Aitchison had her biggest break yet when she sang the chorus of Iggy Azalea's hit single "Fancy".  Riding this success, she not only released a second album, she contributed what became a hit single to a film soundtrack and began writing songs for other artists, which she discovered that she really enjoyed.  The year saw her as an opener for tours by major acts such as Katy Perry.</p>
        <p>The past 3 years have seen Aitchison as busy as ever, dropping singles, EP's, mixtapes, touring, and writing songs for others.  She hinted in 2015 that she was beginning work on her third album, which she said would be her most poppy, electronic music of her career.  This marked a significant step for Aitchison, as prior to this, despite getting so much joy from writing pop songs for others, she had avoided any overt pop in her own music, wanting to be taken seriously by more alternative and indie audiences.  Many believe that this may explain why her first two albums and mixtapes were received with lukewarm reviews - she seemed to be restraining herself.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, this third album is still apparently in the works, but in the meantime, Aitchison has been busier than ever, releasing two mixtapes and a single ("Boys")in 2017.  While "Boys" was supposedly the first release from the upcoming album, <em>Number 1 Angel</em> and <em>Pop 2</em> were described by Aitchison as opportunities to collaborate with some of her favorite artists from across the pop world, as well as a way to release a bunch of songs she had been writing (apparently in addition to whatever she is writing for the still forthcoming third LP).  These mixtapes are full of fun and quirky pop songs with the help of the bizarre and unique production of AG Cook, the head of England's PC Music label.  Cook and his producer collaborators are know for their unique take on pop, creating songs that are undeniably catchy but also full of twists and turns and odd sound effects one would expect from more underground EDM producers.  The production is often just plain goofy, which seems to fit Aitchison's songs perfectly, especially on the particularly impressive <em>Pop 2</em>.</p>
