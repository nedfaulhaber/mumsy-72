        <p>Jahron Anthony Brathwaite, known in the music arena as PartyNextDoor, is a Canadian R&B and pop singer, songwriter, and rapper who was the first artist signed to fellow Canadian Drake's OVO record label back in 2013.  Though his own music hasn't produced a widespread public following, fans deeper into the R&B and hip-hop community know him well.  He's worked with major artists such as Lil Wayne, and he himself has had high-profile guests on his own records, most recently features of Halsey (also on this mix) and veteran rapper Rick Ross on his EP <em>Seven Days</em>, which was named for the fact that it was completed in only seven days.</p>
        <p>While his music hasn't made him a star, his songwriting has made him rich.  In 2015, he penned "Work" and "Sex With Me" for Rihanna's album <em>ANTI</em>.  "Work" became the biggest hit of early 2016, spending 9 weeks at number one.  While it certainly didn't do anything to increase his public visibility, it put him in rarefied air in the music business.  There's little doubt that after being responsible for what will most likely become one of the most famous hits for a legendary artist, no matter what happens with his own music and performing career, Brathwaite has plenty of successes waiting for him in the future.</p>
