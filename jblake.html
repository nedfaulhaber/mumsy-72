        <p>Back in 2011, it seemed that a collaboration between the rural folk sound of Wisconsin native Justin Vernon (aka Bon Iver) and electronic dance sound of the English James Blake would be as unlikely as a Bob Dylan and Beyonc√© duet.  That notion was dispelled when Blake released his first single "Fall Creek Boys Choir" from his EP <em>Enough Thunder</em>, which was met with critical acclaim for its "Frankenstein-style creation...that lives and breathes" (Horowitz - PopMatters) as a truly unique musical statement.</p>
        <p>The friendship between Blake and Vernon remained strong, and in 2016, when Blake released his brooding, electronic masterpiece <em>The Colour in Anything</em>, Vernon was featured on the track "I Need a Forest Fire".  Uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time, the beauty of the harmonies of the two friends is a highlight on the album, and when Blake performed at the Glastonbury Festival in 2016, Vernon <a class="info-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WaKvUlhQCQ" target="_blank">joined him on stage</a> to perform it.  Vernon's appearance and the surprise feature of LA rapper Vince Staples (also on this mix) on a remix of Blake's "Timeless" punctuated an incredible set by Blake and his trio.</p>
        <p>These days, a collaboration between Vernon and Blake seems to make way more sense than it did 7 years ago.  The two have explored musical territory that has brought their styles closer, with Blake introducing a focus on songwriting into his electronica and Vernon utilizing heavy pitch-shifting and auto-tune electronic effects on his recent release <em>22 A Million</em>.  Will there be another collaboration between the two close friends?  Fans can only hope.</p>
