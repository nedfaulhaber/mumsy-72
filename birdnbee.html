        <p>Musical partners Inara George and Greg Kurstin have been making catchy dream pop together since 2006.  Both have been active as highly talented artists in their own right.  George's jazz inflected vocals can be heard on progressive records by influential artists such as Van Dyke Parks (also on this mix) and with multiple other musical projects of her own.  Kurstin is a Grammy-nominated multi-instrumentalist and producer who has produced records for Sia, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kylie Minogue, and Beck, just to name a few.  George and Kurstin met in 2006 and soon found a musical connection that had them obsessively writing in studios in LA, resulting in their debut EP <em>Again and Again and Again and Again</em>, which resulted in the song "Fucking Boyfriend" charting at number one on the <em>Billboard</em> Hot Dance Party chart.</p>
        <p>After releasing a full length album in 2007, the pair continued to get increasing exposure over the next two years when multiple TV and film soundtracks featured some of their songs, including <em>Grey's Anatomy</em>, <em>Sex and the City</em>, and Judd Apatow's <em>Forgetting Sarah Marshall</em>.  Additionally, their recording of "Carol of the Bells" was featured by Apple's iTunes Store during the holiday season.</p>
        <p>Their most recent album, <em>Recreational Love</em>, builds on the late-70's smooth dance sounds that they exhibited on their cult-hit <em>Interpreting the Masters Volume 1: A Tribute to Daryl Hall and John Oates</em>, an album entirely dedicated to covers of Hall & Oates songs.  Chock full of catchy and fun dance songs that translated perfectly to the stage, <em>Recreational Love</em> was a big hit with fans.  While Kurstin wasn't able to tour for the album, a very-pregnant George went out on the road with an incredible all-female pop band that charmed critics and concert goers with a dance-dominated set of four-part harmonies that featured the group wearing matching white dresses, tie dye shirts, and bright white Converse high-tops.</p>
        <p>Though when (or if) the next <em>Bird and the Bee</em> will be released is unknown, both artists have kept more than busy, with George releasing a single in January of this year and Kurstin winning multiple grammies for his role in producing and co-writing the massive hit "Hello" by Adele.</p>
