        <p>Rarely has an artist put out an album with a more appropriate title than Kamasi Washington's debut <em>The Epic</em>.  The record is a tour de force of music that reinvigorates a jazz genre that sorely needs a fresh boost.  AND, incredibly, to make it all the more epic, Washington's first record is a triple album.  The album art is stunning, and every minute of the nearly 3 hours of music is incredible - whether roaringly intense, liltingly beautiful, or stunningly vast, he and his virtuoso band have created a masterpiece.</p>
        <p>Washington's musical journey is exceptional for a variety of reasons.  He grew up in Inglewood, CA, in a poor black neighborhood.  Like most other kids at school, he was a huge hip-hop fan.  Washington and his close friends were different, though, because they were equally deep into jazz music, thanks to his saxophonist father (who occasionally jams with Kamasi's band today).  Though he began with clarinet, Washington one day picked up his father's saxophone and never looked back.  His wide musical taste and abilities is reflected in the multitude of artists he played with prior to his debut record - everyone from Snoop Dogg to former John Coltrane pianist McCoy Tyner.  Most recently, he's been working with electronic experimentalist Flying Lotus and helped produce rapper Kendrick Lamar's landmark album <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>.</p>
        <p>With his own band, though, he has shown that his talents go way beyond accompaniment.  His 12-piece band is as massive in stature as Washington is himself - two vocalists, two bass players, and two drummers, along with piano and horns.  Amazingly, they are completely tasteful, never stepping on each other's toes - while achieving the intensity and reach of the some of the similarly expansive experimental groups of the 1960's, they avoid the pitfall of cacophony that some of these groups fell prey to.  Part of this success may come from the fact that Washington's band is mostly made up of friends that go back to grade school in Inglewood, with similar musical sensibilities, who have played together since they were kids.  Seeing the band live, they seem like they are still having as much fun as they were as teenagers.</p>
        <p>"The Magnificent 7" is a perfect example of Washington's band reaching for new musical heights, propelled by a monstrous rhythm section that shows off the virtuosity and tightness of his two drummers, Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Tony Austin.  The song is reminiscent of Coltrane's best work, but with a fresh take that shows off the youth of the group and its modern groove.  Like the album it comes from, it's a truly Epic journey.</p>
